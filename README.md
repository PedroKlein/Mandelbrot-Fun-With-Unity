# Mandelbrot-Fun-With-Unity

## Brief Explanation
### Imaginary plane
The equation ![equation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/MandelbrotSet/NumberedEquation1.gif) is transpose as **C** being the red dot C and **Z** the blue dot Z. The iterations of this equation generates the different vertices of the grey line, which converges to zero within the circle and to infinity outside it (only when **C** equals to 0, as represented by the julia set when **C** is 0).

### Mandelbrot set
The mandelbrot set is generated by fixing the **Z** value to 0 and **C** being the uv coordinate of the shader (0 at the center of the screen). Changing the value of **Z** will also change the set. By changing **C** we can observe that it will always be stable within the black regions and unstable (tend to infinity) otherwise.

### Julia set
The julia set is generated by fixing the **C** value to 0 and **Z** being the uv coordinate of the shader (0 at the center of the screen). Changing the value of **C** will drastically change the set. By changing **Z** we can observe that it will always be stable within the black regions and unstable (tend to infinity) otherwise.  

### Exploration mode
Exploration mode allowes the movement of the camera with **WASD** keys and zoom in with **SPACE** and out with **SHIFT**.

By changing the number of iterations we change the resolution of the "stable" (black) region, meaning that an infinite amount of iteration would enable infinite zoom.

**For better render quality is advised to play in fullscreen mode by pressing F11 key.**
